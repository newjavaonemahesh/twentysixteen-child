Many professional websites display font icons in addition to text - say, on navigation bars, side bars, dashboard, widgetted sections, footers, posts.  Icons are there everywhere.  Similarly, look at the Wordpress admin dashboard.  You can see icons almost everywhere.

Wordpress does not support using a icon for menu item out of the box.  But the widespread use of icons mean that it is a core functionality that is embedded into WP core.
